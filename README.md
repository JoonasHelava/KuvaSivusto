Web server programming practical work
# Info
This project was made to simulate very simple version of promotion algorithm. Promotion algorithm is working as a kind of feedback loop, where content that is getting popular (votes or comments) will be showing in frontpage and getting more views via that.
The code can be modified to promote any kind of content, not only pictures like in this use case example.
